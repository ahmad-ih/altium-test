## NanoBoard-NB1

The NanoBoard-NB1 is Altium's legacy development platform for the rapid testing of FPGA designs. It consists of a motherboard with a variety of commonly used peripherals, and a range of plug-in FPGA or CPLD daughter boards.

The emergence of low-cost FPGA and CPLD devices from multiple vendors has resulted in the need
for a state of the art development system. The NB1 NanoBoard, in conjunction with the Altium
Designer PC-based development software allows hardware engineers and embedded systems
developers to develop and evaluate complex programmable logic-based systems.

In addition to providing schematic and PCB tools, the Altium Designer development system also allows
complete FPGA designs to be created, designed and debugged. FPGA projects can be created with
the schematic editor, using supplied schematic library components covering an extensive palette of IP
functions, including a range of industry-standard microcontrollers.

The NanoBoard includes a unique communications protocol called NanoTalk, that provides connection
between a host PC running the software and the NanoBoard. NanoTalk provides the ability to
daisychain a number of NanoBoards, and communications access from the software to all resources
on the NanoBoard, or daisychained sequence of NanoBoards.
